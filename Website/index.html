					<p class="w3-center"><em>Stocks vs. Mutual Funds</em></p>
					<p>In this section, we will provide a brief overview of stocks and mutual funds, and specifically their differences. Additionally, we will cover Responsible Investing, and the Environmental, Social, and Goverance (ESG) tracking important to socially responsible investing.
					</p>

					<p>
						Information for both mutual funds and stocks are provided below. If you are familiar with the difference, you may want to skip to, here, otherwise continue…
						<br>
						Choosing between mutual funds or stocks depends on how much risk vs return you are predated to handle. Higher returns are accompanied by higher risk. 
						<br>
						Stocks are riskier than mutual funds. Funds are a pool of many stocks or bonds. The pooling reduces risk, because, if one company in the fund has poor performance, its loss is balanced by other businesses that perform well.  This lowers the risk, thanks to diversification. Owning one individual stock carries more risk than owning several (which you can accomplish via a fund). This type of risk is known as unsystematic risk. Unsystematic risk is risk that CAN be diversified against.
						<br>
						There is also systematic risk, which is risk that you CANNOT diversify against. This would be similar to market risk or volatility risk. There is risk associated with investing. If the market as a whole declines in value, that is not something that can easily be diversified against.
						<br>
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="section" id="educationClass">
				<div class="container">
					<p>
						If you want to invest in individual stocks, most financial planners recommended creating your own set of stocks, diversified between large and small companies, value and growth companies, domestic and international, and between stocks and bonds, according to your risk tolerance. There are numerous companies will to provide guidance in this process. 
						<br>
						In addition to risk and return, it also depends how much time you have to learn about individual companies. Mutual funds don't require as much time to research because the mutual fund manager does that for you. That stated, you need to research the fund, so you know how the particular fund manager is performing. 
						<br>
						To learn about investing in stocks, you need to research which company is the best investment. To do company research, you need to learn how to read financial reports to see how much money the company is making, and what strategies it is using to grow earnings. You must stay apprised of how the economy is doing, and how that will affect that company and its industry. You will want to pick companies who are in industries or sectors that are on the upswing.
						To pick mutual funds, you don't need to learn how each company is doing - that is what the mutual fund manager does. However, you still need to research the past performance of the mutual funds. You also need to decide which sectors seem most promising. Of course, you still need to know how the economy is doing.

				<p>
					Additional things to consider when choosing between funds and stocks?
					<br>1.	Savings Phase – If you are just getting started investing, funds are typically recommended. They have lower minimums for investment and easy access to diversification. Stocks are for more experienced investors that want to fine tune their portfolio and are looking for flexibility in their investments they can not get through funds alone. These generally carry higher minimums to use
					<br>2.	Tax Sensitivity – Stocks offer superior tax efficiency, as it is up to you when you take gains and losses. This is also an area that warrants research, but at a minimum, it is important to be aware.
					<br>3.	Control – Mutual funds provide a hands-off approach. The mutual fund managers do all of the work for you. Once invested, you’ll get periodic statements, and not much else is needed. This solution also means you lose some control and visibility into your specific investments. True transparency in what you are investing only occurs with stocks. Stocks require vigilance though.  You control all of the timing, and buying/selling decisions.  Constant monitoring of the company, market, and overall trends is important for success.

					<p>
						Socially responsible investing (SRI), or social investment, also known as sustainable, socially conscious, "green" or ethical investing, is any investment strategy which seeks to consider both financial return and social good to bring about a social change.

							<p>
								In general, socially responsible investors encourage corporate practices that promote environmental stewardship, consumer protection, human rights, and diversity. The areas of concern recognized by the SRI practitioners are sometimes summarized under the heading of ESG issues: environment, social justice, and corporate governance.

				<h4> Socially Responsible Funds</h4>
				<p>
					<img src="images/USSIF.png" >
					The Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, USSIF, is a leading voice for advancing sustainable, responsible, and impact investing across all asset classes. Their mission is to shift invesment practices towards sustainability, focusing on long-term investment and the generation of positive social and environmental impacts. You can read more about them and access their data directly <a href="http://www.ussif.org/about">here</a>.
				</p>

				<p>Within our analysis, we are incorporating financial, environmental, social, and governance ratings for 202 funds, as self reported by the fund managers with USSIF.</p>

				<br>
				<h4>Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h4>
				<p>
					For Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions, we are leveraging data from the CDP. CDP is a not-for-profit charity that runs the global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states and regions to manage their environmental impacts. To learn more about CDP, you can go <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en">here</a>.

					CDP provides Scope 1 and 2 emissions from 482 of the largest 500 companies in the world by market capitalization. A group called The Greenhouse Gas Protocol has been very influential in defining how organizations should manage and report their GHG, including the establishment of three categories of emissions (Scope). The separation of GHG emissions into scopes is designed to avoid ‘double-counting’ of emissions, and is also intended to help organizations categorize GHG into those that they control versus those that they can influence.
					Scope 1 are also referred to as Direct GHG, and are defined as ‘emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the organization’, such as:
					<table border=0px; align="center";>
						<tr><td align="left"><li >Stationary Combustion: from the combustion of fossil fuels (e.g. natural gas, fuel oil, propane, etc.) for comfort heating or other industrial applications</li></td></tr>
						<tr><td align="left"><li>Mobile Combustion: from the combustion of fossil fuels (e.g. gasoline, diesel) used in the operation of vehicles or other forms of mobile transportation</li></td></tr>
						<tr><td align="left"><li>Process Emissions: emissions released during the manufacturing process in specific industry sectors (e.g. cement, iron and steel, ammonia)</li></td></tr>
						<tr><td align="left"><li>Fugitive Emissions: unintentional release of GHG from sources including refrigerant systems and natural gas distribution</li></td></tr>

				<p>According to the Human Rights Commission, major companies in recent years have accelerated their efforts to improve policies affecting LGBTQ employees and their families. In 2017, 123 companies posted gains in their HRC ratings - with television cable company Charter Communications (CHTR) and aerospace and defense giant Lockheed Martin (LM) posting the most gains. Of those who improved year over year, 23 are rated Strong Buy based on analyst recommendations. Analyst recommendations are a likert scale assessment of whether it is a good time to buy or sell a particular stock - Strong Sell, Moderate Sell, Hold, Moderate Buy, Strong Buy. The recommendations used here are as of November 12, 2017.</p>
				<p>A handful of companies slid backward from 2016 to 2017. Genuine Parts Company (GPC), which sells and distributes car parts and electronics, lost the most points year over year. Also notably, the big box store Costco (COST) lost points because it does not enforce non-discrimination standards that include sexual orientation and gender identity for its vendors. Costco also lost points because it does not have transgender-inclusive health insurance coverage.</p>

				<p>More than 200 companies earned perfect scores on HRC's Corporate Equality Index (CEI). They are represented above by sector (color) and market cap (size). Market cap is the market value of a company's outstanding shares and can be a useful guide when making investment choices. Companies typically fall into three market cap categories: small-, mid- and large-cap. Historical financial performance shows large-cap companies are typically less risky but slow to grow, while small-cap companies have rapid growth potential but come with more risk. 
					If you want low-risk investments, explore the larger boxes - companies like Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL) and Huron Consulting Group (HURN). If you're willing to absorb more risk, check out the smaller boxes
				To get a sense for which business sectors are leading the way when it comes to corporate equality, select the "Count" radio button above. Consumer Services, which includes companies like Starbucks, CBS Broadcasting and restaurant finder app Yelp, has the highest count of companies with perfect CEI scores. The Technology sector also has a large share of perfect scores, while the Energy and Transportation Industries have less representation.</p>
