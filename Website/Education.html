  <h3 class="w3-center"><em>Stocks vs. Mutual Funds</em></h3>
  <p>In this section, we will provide a brief overview of stocks and mutual funds, and specifically their differences. Additionally, we will cover Responsible Investing, and the Environmental, Social, and Goverance (ESG) tracking important to socially responsible investing.
    <br>
    <br>
    Information for both mutual funds and stocks are provided below. If you are familiar with the difference, you may want to skip to, here, otherwise continue.

      	<br>
        Choosing between mutual funds or stocks depends on how much risk vs return you are predated to handle. Higher returns are accompanied by higher risk. 
        <br>
        <br>
       Stocks are riskier than mutual funds. Funds are a pool of many stocks or bonds. The pooling reduces risk because if one company in the fund has poor performance, its loss is balanced by other businesses that perform well.  This lowers the risk, thanks to diversification. Owning one individual stock carries more risk than owning several (which you can accomplish via a fund). This type of risk is known as unsystematic risk. Unsystematic risk is risk that <em>can</em> be diversified against.
       <br><br>
       There is also systematic risk, which is risk that you <em>cannot</em> diversify against. This would be similar to market risk or volatility risk. There is risk associated with investing. If the market as a whole declines in value, that is not something that can easily be diversified against.
       <br><br>

       If you want to invest in individual stocks, most financial planners recommended creating your own set of stocks, diversified between large and small companies, value and growth companies, domestic and international, and between stocks and bonds, according to your risk tolerance. There are numerous companies that will to provide guidance in this process. 
       <br><br>
       In addition to risk and return, it also depends how much time you have to learn about individual companies. Mutual funds don't require as much research because the mutual fund manager does that for you. That stated, you need to research the fund, so you know how the particular fund manager is performing. You also need to decide which sectors seem most promising and have a general understanding of how the economy is doing. 
       <br><br>
       To learn about investing in stocks, you need to research which company is the best investment. To do company research, you need to learn how to read financial reports to see how much money the company is making, and what strategies it is using to grow earnings. You must stay apprised of how the economy is doing, and how that will affect that company and its industry. You will want to pick companies who are in industries or sectors that are on the upswing.

       Additional things to consider when choosing between funds and stocks?
       <br><br>1.	Savings Phase – If you are just getting started investing, funds are typically recommended. They have lower minimums for investment and easy access to diversification. Stocks are for more experienced investors that want to fine tune their portfolio and are looking for flexibility in their investments they can not get through funds alone. These generally carry higher minimums to use
       <br><br>2.	Tax Sensitivity – Stocks offer superior tax efficiency, as it is up to you when you take gains and losses. This is also an area that warrants research, but at a minimum, it is important to be aware.
       <br><br>3.	Control – Mutual funds provide a hands-off approach. The mutual fund managers do all of the work for you. Once invested, you’ll get periodic statements, and not much else is needed. This solution also means you lose some control and visibility into your specific investments. True transparency in what you are investing only occurs with stocks. Stocks require vigilance though.  You control all of the timing, and buying/selling decisions.  Constant monitoring of the company, market, and overall trends is important for success.

  <h2 class="w3-center">Socially Responsible Investing - The Basics</h2>
  <p>
  	Socially responsible investing (SRI), or social investment, is also known as sustainable, socially conscious, "green" or ethical investing. The terms refer to any investment strategy which seeks to consider both financial return and social good to bring about a social change.
  </p>
  <div class="w3-row">
    <div class="w3-col m6 w3-left w3-padding-64">
      <p>
        In general, socially responsible investors encourage corporate practices that promote environmental stewardship, consumer protection, human rights, and diversity. The areas of concern recognized by the SRI practitioners are sometimes summarized under the heading of ESG issues: <strong>environment, social justice, and corporate governance.</strong>
      </p>

      Whether socially responsible investing leads to better returns than traditional investing is still up for debate.  A number of factors can influence a stock or fund's performance, so isolating sustainability initiatives as a cause of positive performance is difficult.  One thing is certain - there is a growing demand from investors for socially responsible investment options. 
      <br><br> 
      The sections below outline different methods for assessing the SRI efforts of individual companies or funds. Read through the description, then navigate to the Investigation section of this site to dive deeper into the data.

  <h4> Socially Responsible Funds</h4>
  <p>
    <img src="images/USSIF.png" >
    The Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, USSIF, is a leading voice for advancing sustainable, responsible, and impact investing across all asset classes. Their mission is to shift invesment practices towards sustainability, focusing on long-term investment and the generation of positive social and environmental impacts. You can read more about them and access their data directly <a href="http://www.ussif.org/about">here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Within our analysis, we are incorporating financial, environmental, social, and governance ratings for 202 funds, as self reported by the fund managers with USSIF.</p>

  <h4>Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h4>
  <p>
    For Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions, we are leveraging data from the CDP. CDP is a not-for-profit charity that runs the global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states and regions to manage their environmental impacts. To learn more about CDP, you can go <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en">here</a>.

    CDP provides Scope 1 and 2 emissions from 482 of the largest 500 companies in the world by market capitalization. A group called The Greenhouse Gas Protocol has been very influential in defining how organizations should manage and report their GHG, including the establishment of three categories of emissions (Scope). The separation of GHG emissions into scopes is designed to avoid ‘double-counting’ of emissions, and is also intended to help organizations categorize GHG into those that they control versus those that they can influence.
    Scope 1 are also referred to as Direct GHG, and are defined as ‘emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the organization’, such as:
    <table border=0px; align="center";>
     <tr><td align="left"><li >Stationary Combustion: from the combustion of fossil fuels (e.g. natural gas, fuel oil, propane, etc.) for comfort heating or other industrial applications</li></td></tr>
     <tr><td align="left"><li>Mobile Combustion: from the combustion of fossil fuels (e.g. gasoline, diesel) used in the operation of vehicles or other forms of mobile transportation</li></td></tr>
     <tr><td align="left"><li>Process Emissions: emissions released during the manufacturing process in specific industry sectors (e.g. cement, iron and steel, ammonia)</li></td></tr>
     <tr><td align="left"><li>Fugitive Emissions: unintentional release of GHG from sources including refrigerant systems and natural gas distribution</li></td></tr>
   </table>

 <h4>Corporate Equality</h4>
 <p>
  The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation together serve as America's largest civil rights organization working to achieve LGBTQ equality. By inspiring and engaging individuals and communities, HRC strives to end discrimination against LGBTQ people and realize a world that achieves fundamental fairness and equality for all.

  Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index is the national benchmarking tool on corporate policies and practices pertinent to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees.

 <h4>Deforestestion and Water Sustainability</h4>
 <p>
  CDP is a not-for-profit charity that runs the global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states and regions to manage their environmental impacts.  CDP concentrates on getting investors, companies, and cities to take action to build a truly sustainable economy by understanding and measuring their environmental impact.
  Above we mentioned their work with Greenhouse Gas Emissions. This section focuses on two areas, forest and water. Quoting Katie McCoy - Head of forests, CDP, <br>
  <i>“Supply chains are like rows of dominoes: if unsustainable commodities enter the top of a supply chain, the effects will cascade throughout. Failing to address deforestation will have knock-on reputational impacts, manifesting themselves as consumer boycotts, community opposition, and increased regulatory scrutiny. Business growth is at risk.”</i>
   <br><br>
  Sustainable practices are not just important for the environment, but also the bottom-line of companies (and thus our investments).
  According to CDP,<br><i> “77% of reporting companies recognize at least one supply chain risk with the potential to generate a substantive change in business operations, revenue or expenditure…
  However, only 42% of companies have evaluated the availability or quality of forest-risk commodities over the medium-term. With such a large proportion of company revenues attached to these commodities; companies need to ensure they are planning for the long-term to ensure the sustainable supply of these commodities in future.”</i>
  <br>
  Additionally, water security is essential to tackling climate change and protecting the bottom line.
  CDP's water program motivates companies to disclose and reduce their environmental impacts by using the power of investors and customers. The data CDP collects helps influential decision makers to reduce risk, capitalize on opportunities and drive action towards a more sustainable world.
